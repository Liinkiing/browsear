## Usage

Just click the big 'Record' button, and wait until it recognize the sound. You can
stop it by yourself, but remember that the longer you wait the greater the chance of finding
a song will be.

## Shortcuts

By default, use `Ctrl+Shift+K` (or `Command+Shift+X` on mac) to start the recognition process
in background, without opening the popup. A small badge will indicate the new
recognized sounds. The shortcut can be freely re-assigned in your browser shortcuts preference panel.
