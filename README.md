## Installation

Because it is currently not approved in the **Chrome Web Store**, you can freely test it
by building the extension and load the unpacked version (located in `build` folder)

```bash
$ yarn
# install dependencies

$ yarn build
# build production-ready files into a 'build' folder
```

### In Chrome web browser

1. Go to: [**chrome://extensions**](chrome://extensions)
2. Toggle: "**developer mode**" on
3. Click on: "**Load unpacked**"
4. Select the newly created folder "**build**" from the project folder

### In Firefox web browser

1. Go to: [**about:debugging**](about:debugging)
2. Select: "**Enable add-on debugging**"
3. Click on: "**Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦**"
4. Open the newly created folder "**build**" from the project folder, and choose the "**manifest.json**" file

## Usage

Just click the big 'Record' button, and wait until it recognize the sound. You can
stop it by yourself, but remember that the longer you wait the greater the chance of finding
a song will be.

## Shortcuts

By default, use `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Command+Shift+X` on mac) to start the recognition process
in background, without opening the popup. A small badge will indicate the new
recognized sounds. The shortcut can be freely re-assigned in your browser shortcuts preference panel.
